//! One entry of a page's recording: a Skia picture, or a blurred draw kept as
//! ours so that its blur is made where the page is played back.
//!
//! A picture fixes everything about a draw when it is recorded, and a page is
//! played back under transforms the draw never saw: an export at a density,
//! a tile's origin, a canvas drawn into another at a size. Most of a draw
//! scales with them. How a blur is made does not have to: Skia's coverage
//! blur stops at a sigma of 128 device pixels, so a choice of it made at
//! density 1 can ask it for more than it draws at density 4. A [`BlurOp`]
//! checks that choice when it is played back, against the sigma it has
//! there.
